How to make a bonziworld server
First one, you will need to install grunt.js and Node.JS in your computer.

Open the command prompt as administrator.
Follow the instructions (heyjoeway instructions are here):

Client

cd src
npm install
grunt build_www
cd ..

Server

cd server
npm install
node index.js

After this, BonziWORLD will be accessible on port 3000. (http://localhost:3000/)
You can change any port you want (FIRST EDIT THE script.min.js and settings.json for changing the port)

Second one. You need a port forwarding to access anyone on the server.
Type your private IP 192.168.0.1
If you have D-Link or TP-Link for fast connection.
Click their menus port forwarding, type the same port and add to your port.
Share the IP address and what are you looking for!

I'm not responsible if you screw up anything with your computer while setting this up. I have no idea how you would, but someone will find a way. I also will not provide support for installing dependencies. If you have everything installed properly, the above commands will work.
