<h2>Others</h2>
<p>This script uses AutoJoin, but I will disable by renaming that to disable joining system. Script code:</p>
<textarea style="resize:none;">setInterval(function(){login()}, 1000);</textarea>
<p>In private rooms have a full command access.</p>
<p>If name crashes that (Maximum is 20,000 chars), you have to paste a file for 4 KB texts, paste it and get craziness!</p>
<p>If this speed is too high, change it.</p>
<p>If you use JavaScript with colors, it won't crash.</p>
<p>Use the name like a hacker of the intervals.</p>
<hr noshade>
<p>FOR SERVERS. Besides, the server will automatically log in when you join this site. But there's no way to join the private room ID or typing the your own name.</p>
<p>This email was removed due a damnson. By using YouTube, I won't do that. I will go to other social media like that.</p>
