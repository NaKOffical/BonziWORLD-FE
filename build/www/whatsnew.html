		<h2 style="color:lime;mix-blend-mode: negation;text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px red, -2px 2px 4px cyan, -2px -2px 4px yellow, 2px -2px 4px blue;box-shadow: 2px 2px 4px red, -2px 2px 4px cyan, -2px -2px 4px yellow, 2px -2px 4px blue;">Well, hello there? Anybody is here? But anyways, we've replaced the full version of BonziWORLD, which means, that is very disappointed with this update. I'll keep the server up, but you can imagine, fun, but you can't handle that. I've finished the project of BonziWORLD FE, and now, I finished Classic BonziWORLD, then OnuteWORLD, then I won't update the site for other sites forever, this is chance, OBWR and BWRR are very deprecated, but BWRR is just an discontinued software but with extra steps. I have no fun to study BonziWORLD, get a life. How much monstrosity was is, OVER 90%! That's not good, not even users flooded my new BonziWORLD FE and now, 2021 is still a discontinued version of BWFE and they ruin anything! Get it? No, you can reenact, but you don't react.</h2>
		<h2 style="color:lime;mix-blend-mode: color-burn;text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px red, -2px 2px 4px cyan, -2px -2px 4px yellow, 2px -2px 4px blue;box-shadow: 2px 2px 4px red, -2px 2px 4px cyan, -2px -2px 4px yellow, 2px -2px 4px blue;">NOTICE: This is the final version of BWFE (BonziWORLD FE). But it will not to be updated and the list of new updates will not be updated any more. We're currently updating another version of BonziWORLD like as OBWR (New BW2, Legacy BonziWORLD Revived, or easy to call Old BonziWORLD: Revived!) or BWRR (BonziWORLD Revived Reconstructed).</h2>
